#Snake Game 🐍🎮

This is a basic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The player controls the snake using the WASD keys to move up, down, left, or right, with the goal of eating food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows in size and the speed increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. The current score and high score are displayed at the top of the screen.

I have provided two codes. The file named GameExplained.py contains an explanation for each line of the code. The other file, SnakeGame.py, is the game without explanations. Both codes work.
